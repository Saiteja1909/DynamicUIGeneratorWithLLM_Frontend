# Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js vserion 20.15.0: [Download and install Node.js v20.15.0](https://nodejs.org/dist/v20.15.0/node-v20.15.0-x64.msi), including the npm package manager.

# Project Setup
Clone the Repository

Clone the frontend repository from Github to your local machine using:

`git clone https://github.com/Saiteja1909/DynamicUIGeneratorWithLLM_Frontend.git`

Navigate into the project directory:

`cd DynamicUIGeneratorWithLLM_Frontend`

# Install Dependencies

Run the following command in the root directory of the project to install the necessary dependencies:

`npm install`

# Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.13.

## Running the Application (Development server)

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
